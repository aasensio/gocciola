# One single ion (Ca II) with 5 bound levels, 5 active transitions,
# 5 radiative (R) transitions, and 10 collisional (C) transitions.
# NOTE: active transitions ... The RT equation has to be solved
#       pasive transitions ... Radiation Temperatures a used
# NOTE: active + passive transitions = number of R transitions = NR.
